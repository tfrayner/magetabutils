Bio::MAGETAB::Util::Web Documentation
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This package contains a web application built using the
"magetab-utils" package and the Catalyst framework to allow users to
interact with data stored in a Bio::MAGETAB::Util::Persistence
database (based on the Tangram perl modules).

At the moment this application is more of a successful
proof-of-principle than a serious production web application, but if
there is sufficient demand this code may be developed further.

See the documentation for the "magetab-utils" package for information
on how to set up the database.

Dependencies
------------

This web application requires that the Bio::MAGETAB::Util modules are
installed. These modules are provided by the "magetab-utils" package,
available from the MAGE-TAB Utilities SourceForge project page.

The following CPAN modules are also required (see http://www.cpan.org):

Catalyst::Runtime
Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader
Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple
Catalyst::Action::RenderView
Tangram
Class::Tangram
Config::YAML

Scripts
-------

All the usual Catalyst scripts are included in the package. Run
./script/bio_magetab_util_web_server.pl to test the application.
