=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Protocol - MAGE-TAB protocol class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Protocol;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to describe experimental protocols in MAGE-TAB. It
can either contain all the information about a protocol itself, or it
can link to a protocol entry in a suitable database via its
superclass. See the L<DatabaseEntry|Bio::MAGETAB::DatabaseEntry> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the protocol (data type: String).

=item text (optional)

A free-text description of the protocol, giving all the steps in the
procedure (data type: String).

=item software (optional)

The software used in the protocol. Multiple softwares must be
concatenated into a single value (data type: String).

=item hardware (optional)

The hardware used in the protocol. Multiple hardwares must be
concatenated into a single value (data type: String).

=item protocolType (optional)

The type of the protocol ('nucleic_acid_extraction','labeling' etc.;
data type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=item contact (optional)

A contact for more information on the protocol. Multiple contacts must
be concatenated into a single value (data type: String).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
