=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm - MAGE-TAB controlled term class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information on controlled terms in
MAGE-TAB. These will often (but not always) be terms from an ontology,
in which case the source of these terms should also be given via the
parent class DatabaseEntry attributes. See
the L<DatabaseEntry|Bio::MAGETAB::DatabaseEntry> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item category (required)

A category to provide context for the term (data type: String).

=item value (required)

The term value itself (data type: String).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
