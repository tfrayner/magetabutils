=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Edge - MAGE-TAB edge class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Edge;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information on edges in the experimental
design graph described by a MAGE-TAB SDRF. Each Edge must link to both
an input and an output Node. See the L<BaseClass|Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> class for superclass
methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item inputNode (required)

The Node object which feeds into this edge (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Node).

=item outputNode (required)

The Node object leading away from this edge (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Node)

=item protocolApplications (optional)

A list of ProtocolApplications associated with the edge (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ProtocolApplication).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
