=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Comment - MAGE-TAB user-defined comment class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Comment;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store user-defined comments in MAGE-TAB. The
MAGE-TAB specification indicates that these comments may be legally
ignored by downstream data processing operations, and so therefore
should not be used for experimental annotation purposes. See
L<Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the comment, used to indicate the context in which the
value may be interpreted (data type: String).

=item value (required)

The actual value of the comment (data type: String)

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
