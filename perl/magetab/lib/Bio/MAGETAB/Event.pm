Bio::MAGETAB::Event - Abstract event class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Event;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract class from which all MAGE-TAB Event classes
(Assay, DataAcquisition, Normalization) are derived. It cannot be
instantiated directly. See the L<Node|Bio::MAGETAB::Node> class for superclass
methods.

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
