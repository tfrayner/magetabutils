=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::TermSource - MAGE-TAB term source class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::TermSource;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to describe the sources of controlled terms within
a MAGE-TAB document. These term sources may be databases, ontologies,
or even just local controlled vocabularies expressed as a flat
file. See L<Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the term source (data type: String).

=item uri (optional)

A URI specifying where the term source is located (data type: Uri).

=item version (optional)

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
