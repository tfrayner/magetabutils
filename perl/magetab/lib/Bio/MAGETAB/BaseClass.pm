=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass - Abstract base class for all MAGE-TAB classes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is the abstract base class from which all of the MAGE-TAB
classes are derived. It cannot be instantiated directly, but provides
methods and attributes common to all MAGE-TAB objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item namespace (optional)

The namespace associated with any object identifiers (data type:
String).

=item authority (optional)

The authority responsible for assignment of object identifiers
(data type: String).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.

Methods not related to instantiated object attributes are listed below:

=over 2

=item set_ClassContainer

Class method which stores a Bio::MAGETAB container object which will
then be used to store all subsequent instances of any
Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass derived class (i.e., any MAGE-TAB object).

=item get_ClassContainer

Class method which retrieves the Bio::MAGETAB container object. This
can be used to navigate from a MAGE-TAB object instance to a listing
of all MAGE-TAB objects of a given type.

=item has_ClassContainer

Class method indicating whether or not a Bio::MAGETAB container object
has been associated with this class.
