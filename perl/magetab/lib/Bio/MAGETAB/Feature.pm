Bio::MAGETAB::Feature - MAGE-TAB feature class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Feature;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

the array. See the L<DesignElement|Bio::MAGETAB::DesignElement> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item blockCol (required)

The block column number of the feature (data type: Integer).

=item blockRow (required)

The block row number of the feature (data type: Integer).

=item col (required)

The number of the feature's column within the enclosing block (data
type: Integer).

=item row (required)

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
