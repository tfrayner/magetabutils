=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::DesignElement - Abstract design element class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::DesignElement;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract class from which all MAGE-TAB DesignElement
classes (Feature, Reporter, CompositeElement) are derived. It cannot
be instantiated directly. See the L<BaseClass|Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> class for
superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item chromosome (optional)

The chromosome from which the design element is derived. This is
primarily used in either the Reporter or CompositeElement subclass to
support coordinate-based design elements in data matrices. It is
possible that these attributes will be moved to a more suitable
subclass in subsequent model versions (data type: String).

=item startPosition (optional)

The start coordinate of the design element on the given chromosome (data
type: Integer).

=item endPosition (optional)

The end coordinate of the design element on the given chromosome (data
type: Integer).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
