=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Data - Abstract data class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Data;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract class from which all MAGE-TAB Data classes
(DataFile, DataMatrix) are derived. It cannot be instantiated
directly. See the L<Node|Bio::MAGETAB::Node> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item uri (required)

The URI where the data can be found (data type: Uri).

=item dataType (required)

The type of the data (typically raw or derived; data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
