=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Types - custom data types for Bio::MAGETAB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Types qw( Date Email Uri );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides definitions and coercion methods for Bio::MAGETAB
data types not included as part of Moose. It is not intended to be
used directly, but is instead called by many of the individual
MAGE-TAB classes.

=head1 TYPES

=over 2

=item Date

Dates are stored and retrieved as DateTime objects. Constructors and
mutators can be passed either a DateTime object, a hashref suitable
for passing to DateTime->new(), or a string date representation. In
the latter case this class attempts to parse the string into a
DateTime object using the Date::Manip module.

=item Email

Email addresses are stored as strings, but are validated using the
Email::Valid module.

=item Uri

All URI strings are stored and retrieved as instances of the standard
perl URI class.
