=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Factor - MAGE-TAB experimental factor class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Factor;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information on the factors being probed by
a given investigation in MAGE-TAB. See the L<BaseClass|Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> class for
superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the factor (data type: String).

=item factorType (optional)

The type of the factor. This typically links to an ontology of
experimental factor terms (e.g. "disease_state", "strain_or_line"
etc.; data type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
