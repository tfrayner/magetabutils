=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Reporter - MAGE-TAB reporter class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Reporter;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information on array reporter elements in
MAGE-TAB. These elements typically correspond to probe sequences, or
in simple cases they may map directly to biologically interesting
sequences (e.g., genes). See L<Bio::MAGETAB::DesignElement> for
superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the reporter (data type: String).

=item sequence (optional)

The actual reporter sequence (usually DNA; data type: String).

=item compositeElements (optional)

A list of CompositeElements composed wholly or in part of this
reporter (data type: Bio::MAGETAB::CompositeElement).

=item databaseEntries (optional)

A list of database entries for the reporter sequence (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::DatabaseEntry).

=item controlType (optional)

Where the reporter describes a control probe, this attribute should be
used to give its type (e.g., 'control_buffer'; data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=item groups (optional)

A list of arbitrary groups to which the reporter belongs. Typically
these groups may describe which probes are experimental and which are
controls; another use might be to indicate the source species of a
probe on a multi-species array design (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
