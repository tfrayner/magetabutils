=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::SDRFRow - MAGE-TAB SDRF row class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::SDRFRow;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to describe the rows in a given MAGE-TAB SDRF
document. Links between Nodes, channel and FactorValue are handled by
this class. See the L<BaseClass|Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> class for superclass methods, and the
L<SDRF|Bio::MAGETAB::SDRF> class for its add_nodes method which can be used to
automatically sort Nodes into SDRFRows.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item nodes (required)

A list of Node objects associated with this SDRF row (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Node).

=item rowNumber (optional)

The number of this row within the SDRF. Rows are assumed to be
numbered from top to bottom, starting at one for the first data
row; however this is not constrained by the model and you may use
whatever local conventions you prefer (data type: Integer).

=item factorValues (optional)

A list of FactorValues associated with this row (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::FactorValue).

=item channel (optional)

The channel used when labeling and scanning for this row (e.g. 'Cy3',
'biotin', 'alexa_588'), usually taken from a suitable ontology (data
type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
