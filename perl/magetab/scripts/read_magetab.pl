 Usage: read_magetab.pl -i <IDF file>

 Options:

    -r :   Use "relaxed" parsing, where undeclared objects are created for you on the fly.
    -x :   Do not attempt to parse any data files listed in the SDRF (specifically, data matrices).
    -n :   Use the specified namespace string.
    -a :   Use the specified authority string.
    -g :   Filename to use for SDRF graph output using GraphViz.
    -d :   DSN, or SQLite database file to load the generated objects into.
    -w :   Attempt to round-trip the MAGE-TAB information by writing a new document
               to the specified directory.

    -v :   Print version information.
    -h :   Print this help.
