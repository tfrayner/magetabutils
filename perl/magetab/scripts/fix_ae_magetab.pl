# This is a simple utility script which can be used to convert the
# current ArrayExpress implementation of the MAGE-TAB format into
# something that the MAGE-TAB Utilities API can reliably read. The
# changes are principally to bring the format into line with the
# MAGE-TAB v1.1 specification, and to fix some common errors. The aim
# is that the output of this script can be parsed using the MAGE-TAB
# Reader classes running in "strict" mode.
