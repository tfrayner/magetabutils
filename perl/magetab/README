Bio::MAGETAB Documentation
==========================

This package provides the perl implementation of the object model used
by the MAGE-TAB Utilities (available from
http://magetabutils.sourceforge.net). The API is mostly finalised, but
some details may yet change where necessary to improve usability.

Note that MAGE-TAB import, export and visualisation functions are not
provided by this package, but rather by the main magetab-utils package
available from the above link.

The Bio::MAGETAB module requires at least version 5.8.1 of perl, and
depends on the following perl modules, all available from CPAN
(http://www.cpan.org):

    Moose
    Moose::Policy
    MooseX::Types
    Params::Coerce
    URI
    Date::Manip
    DateTime
    DateTime::Format::DateManip
    Email::Valid
