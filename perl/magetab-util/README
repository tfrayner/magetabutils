Bio::MAGETAB::Util Documentation
================================

Introduction
------------

This package contains the core MAGE-TAB Utilities Perl modules. This
is a beta release. All functions have now been implemented and most
have test suites; the exceptions include the modules involved in
export of MAGE-TAB documents, which are still a little experimental in
nature. The API is mostly finalised (and fully documented), but some
details may yet change where necessary to improve usability.

Note that this package depends on the Bio::MAGETAB package for
the implementation of its underlying data model.

Package Contents
----------------

This package contains the following directories:

inc       Modules used by the installer Makefile.PL script.
lib       The Bio::MAGETAB::Util modules themselves.
scripts   A set of example scripts. Run without options for usage info.
sql       Optional SQL schema for loading data into a MySQL database.
t         Test suite.

Dependencies
------------

The Bio::MAGETAB::Util module requires at least version 5.8.1 of perl,
a recent version of the Bio::MAGETAB data model package (available
from http://magetabutils.sourceforge.net), and also depends on the
following perl modules, all available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org):

    Moose
    Moose::Policy
    Parse::RecDescent
    Text::CSV_XS

The following modules are recommended, especially if you wish to use
Bio::MAGETAB::Util with the optional database integration modules or
graph visualization:

    Tangram
    DBI
    DBD::SQLite, DBD::mysql or similar
    GraphViz

Scripts
-------

The following example scripts are included in the package:

- read_magetab.pl

    This is the main example script, which can read in a MAGE-TAB
    document (optionally loading it into a local database), and then
    (a) create a graph visualization diagram, and/or (b) round-trip
    the data back into a new set of MAGE-TAB documents.

- deploy_magetab_db.pl

    A script which can deploy the Tangram-based schema to any
    Tangram-supported database engine. Note that the database schema
    generated by Tangram lacks indices or constraints, so performance
    can be poor when using databases generated using this script. For
    serious use with MySQL, the "tangram_with_indices.sql" script in
    the "sql" directory is recommended.

- unload_namespace.pl

    A simple unloader script to remove MAGE-TAB data which has
    previously been loaded into a database, e.g. by read_magetab.pl
