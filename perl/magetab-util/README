Bio::MAGETAB::Util Documentation
================================

This package contains the core MAGE-TAB Utilities Perl modules. This
is a beta release. All functions have now been implemented and most
have test suites; the exceptions include the modules involved in
export of MAGE-TAB documents, which are still a little experimental in
nature. The API is mostly finalised (and fully documented), but some
details may yet change where necessary to improve usability.

Note that this package depends on the Bio::MAGETAB package for
the implementation of its underlying data model.

The Bio::MAGETAB::Util module requires at least version 5.8.1 of perl,
a recent version of the Bio::MAGETAB data model package (available
from http://magetabutils.sourceforge.net), and also depends on the
following perl modules, all available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org):

    Moose
    Moose::Policy
    Parse::RecDescent
    Text::CSV_XS

The following modules are recommended, especially if you wish to use
Bio::MAGETAB::Util with the optional database integration modules:

    Tangram
    DBI
    DBD::SQLite, DBD::mysql or similar
    GraphViz
