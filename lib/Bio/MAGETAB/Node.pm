=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Node - Abstract node class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Node;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract class from which all MAGE-TAB SDRF Node
classes are derived. It cannot be instantiated directly. See
L<Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item inputEdges (optional)

A list of Edges leading into this node (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Edge).

=item outputEdges (optional)

A list of Edges leading out of this node (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Edge).

=item comments (optional)

A list of user-defined comments for the node (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Comment).

=item sdrfRows (optional)

A list of SDRF rows to which this node belongs. This is used to link
channel and factor information to each node in the graph (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::SDRFRow).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
