=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::MatrixColumn - MAGE-TAB matrix column class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::MatrixColumn;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to describe the columns of a MAGE-TAB data
matrix. It acts as a mapping between a numbered column in the matrix,
the quantitation type of that column, and the SDRF node or nodes to
which it applies. See L<Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> for superclass
methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item columnNumber (required)

The number of the column in the data matrix. Columns are assumed to be
numbered from left to right, starting at one for the first data
column; however this is not constrained by the model and you may use
whatever local conventions you prefer (data type: Integer).

=item quantitationType (required)

The quantitation type of the data contained in the column (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=item referencedNodes (required)

A list of Nodes from the SDRF to which the data in this column applies
(data type: Bio::MAGETAB::Node).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
