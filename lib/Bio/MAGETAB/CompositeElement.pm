=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::CompositeElement - MAGE-TAB composite element class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::CompositeElement;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information on composite elements in
MAGE-TAB. These elements typically correspond to biologically relevant
sequences or features (e.g., genes, exons, etc.). See
L<Bio::MAGETAB::DesignElement> for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the composite element (data type: String).

=item databaseEntries (optional)

A list of database entries for the composite element (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::DatabaseEntry).

=item comments (optional)

A list of user-defined comments for the element (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::Comment).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
