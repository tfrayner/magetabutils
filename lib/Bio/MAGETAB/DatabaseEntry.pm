=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::DatabaseEntry - MAGE-TAB database entry class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::DatabaseEntry;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store MAGE-TAB database entry information. These
entries can be from sequence databases (e.g. as attached to
Reporters), ontologies (when using the ControlledTerm subclass), or
databases which hold higher-level metadata (e.g. ArrayDesigns,
Protocols). See L<Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item accession (optional)

The accession number for the database entry (data type: String).

=item termSource (optional)

The TermSource (e.g., database or ontology) which defines the entry,
and which recognises the given accession (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::TermSource).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
