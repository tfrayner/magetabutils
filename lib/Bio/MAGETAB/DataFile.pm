Bio::MAGETAB::DataFile - MAGE-TAB data file class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::DataFile;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class describes data files having arbitrary formats. Most
software-specific data files fall into this category. The sole
exception are data matrices; see the L<DataMatrix|Bio::MAGETAB::DataMatrix> class. See the
L<Data|Bio::MAGETAB::Data> class for superclass methods.

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
