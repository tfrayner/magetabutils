=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Assay - MAGE-TAB assay class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Assay;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information about assays in MAGE-TAB. This
is a generic class which can represent any assay type, specified via
its technologyType attribute. Assays which specifically represent
hybridization events should use a 'hybridization' ControlledTerm as
their technologyType and should also link to an ArrayDesign. See
the L<Event|Bio::MAGETAB::Event> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item technologyType (required)

The type of assay that was performed (hybridization, rtPCR, etc.; data
type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=item arrayDesign (optional)

The array design associated with the assay. Typically this will only
be used for hybridization Assays (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ArrayDesign)

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
