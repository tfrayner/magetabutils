=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Measurement - MAGE-TAB measurement class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Measurement;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to describe measurements in MAGE-TAB. It can
describe individual values, or ranges of values, associated with an
optional unit. See L<Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item measurementType (required)

The type of measurement (i.e., the quantity being measured). This is
equivalent to the ControlledTerm 'category' attribute (data type:
String).

=item value (optional)

A single value for the measurement. If a range of values is being
described this attribute should be left unset, and minValue and
maxValue used instead (data type: String).

=item minValue (optional)

The lower end of a range of values for the measurement. If a single
value is being specified, just use 'value' instead (data type:
String).

=item maxValue (optional)

The upper end of a range of values for the measurement. If a single
value is being specified, just use 'value' instead (data type:
String).

=item unit (optional)

The unit of the measurement (data type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
