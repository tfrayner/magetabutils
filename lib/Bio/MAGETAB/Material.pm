=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::Material - Abstract material class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::Material;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an abstract class from which all MAGE-TAB Material
classes (Source, Sample, Extract, LabeledExtract) are derived. It
cannot be instantiated directly. See L<Bio::MAGETAB::Node> for
superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item name (required)

The name of the material (data type: String).

=item type (optional)

The type of the material (e.g. 'whole_organism', 'organism_part',
'RNA' etc.), usually from a suitable ontology (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=item description (optional)

A free-text description of the material. In general the use of this
attribute is discouraged due to the difficulty of computationally
parsing natural languages (data type: String).

=item characteristics (optional)

A list of characteristics of the material. These may describe any
aspect of the material, and should ideally be taken from an
appropriate ontology (data type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=item measurements (optional)

A list of measurements of the material. These may describe any
measurable property of the material. Units are handled by the
Measurement class (data type: Bio::MAGETAB::Measurement).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
