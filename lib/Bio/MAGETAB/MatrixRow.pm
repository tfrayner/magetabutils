=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::MatrixRow - MAGE-TAB matrix row class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::MatrixRow;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to describe the rows of a MAGE-TAB data matrix. It
acts as a mapping between a numbered row in the matrix, and the design
element (Feature, Reporter or CompositeElement) to which it
applies. See the L<BaseClass|Bio::MAGETAB::BaseClass> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item rowNumber (required)

The number of the row in the data matrix. Rows are assumed to be
numbered from top to bottom, starting at one for the first data
row; however this is not constrained by the model and you may use
whatever local conventions you prefer (data type: Integer).

=item designElement (required)

The DesignElement to which the data in this row applies (data type:
Bio::MAGETAB::DesignElement).

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
