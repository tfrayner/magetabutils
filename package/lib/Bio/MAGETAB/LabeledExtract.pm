=head1 NAME

Bio::MAGETAB::LabeledExtract - MAGE-TAB labeled extract class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::MAGETAB::LabeledExtract;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to store information on labeled extracts
in MAGE-TAB. See the L<Material|Bio::MAGETAB::Material> class for superclass methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item label (optional)

The kind of label used (e.g. Cy3, biotin). This is marked as optional
since it is not formally required by the MAGE-TAB specification (data
type: Bio::MAGETAB::ControlledTerm).

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each attribute has accessor (get_*) and mutator (set_*) methods, and
also predicate (has_*) and clearer (clear_*) methods where the
attribute is optional. Where an attribute represents a one-to-many
relationship the mutator accepts an arrayref and the accessor returns
an array.
