Changelog for Bio::MAGETAB
--------------------------

0.96    Bio::MAGETAB-0.96.tar.gz        Made LabeledExtract->label attribute optional. This
                                          better agrees with the MAGE-TAB specification, even
                                          if it doesn't make much sense in reality. This
                                          change makes SDRF parsing slightly simpler.

0.95    Bio::MAGETAB-0.95.tar.gz        Added BaseClass to the MagicDraw UML model document.
                                        Renamed Feature blockColumn and column attributes
                                          to blockCol and col respectively; this avoids
                                          naming conflicts in some ORM implementations.
                                        Renamed all "type" attributes, similarly to
                                          avoid conflicts.
                                        Converted Source providers and ProtocolApplication
                                          performers to fully-fledged Contact objects.
                                        Relaxed requirement for measurement on ParameterValue.
                                        Added POD coverage tests.

0.91    Bio::MAGETAB-0.91.tar.gz        Added class documentation (POD).

0.9	Bio::MAGETAB-0.9.tar.gz	        Initial public release; API almost finalised.
