# magetabutils
The MAGE-TAB Utilities project provides a simple Perl SDK for parsing, manipulating, visualizing and exporting data in MAGE-TAB format. All file releases are made via CPAN as the Bio::MAGETAB module. Please see https://tfrayner.github.io/magetabutils/ for information on the data model.

The package directory contains the core CPAN module. The web directory contains an example application built using a database persistence layer to store Bio::MAGETAB objects.
